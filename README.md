## Description

This project is an intro into exploring web API's and how to utilize them within a React application. The project utilizes functional React components, React Hooks, and React Routers to develop a simple web application with the Spotify API. The web application allows a user, after logging into their Spotify account, to view their own Playlists, Artists, and Albums, and also search for new Artists. It allows the user to follow Artists which syncs in real time to their Spotify account.

## Installation

1. Clone the directory to your work station.
2. Run `npm install` in your console to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` in your console to start the React server.
4. Go to [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) on the same workstation to view the application. 

## Usage

This can be picked up and utilized to simply browse through Artists, follow them onto your own account, or simply browse your own Artists, Playlists, and Albums. The application does not provide any specific function or purpose, except to show the capabilities of React.js and how it interacts with the Spotify Web API. The application allows a user to search new music and also view their own library.

## Roadmap

With more time, the Reactify application could be expanded to contain more functionality. Here are some of the futher capabilities that could be added to the application:

- More refined search function that searches all possible forms of media (track, artist, album, and podcasts) and organizes the search results to clearly delineate the item and its format
- A user profile section that allows the logged on user to view their own account information
- The ability to play songs in the application through Web Playback
- The ability to see the tracks in an album or by an artist by clicking on the item in the search results
